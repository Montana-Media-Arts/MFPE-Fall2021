One of the things of which I want you to be aware of is Unity's Asset store.  There are many free and paid assets that you can use in your project.  The one we will use is the Unity Playground.

1. Go to **Window** -> **Asset Store**. 
2. Click **Search online**.
3. In the **Search for assets**, type **Unity Playground**. * Note if they are having a sale, you may need to remove the sale filter.
3. Click on the **Unity Playground**.
4. Click on **Download**.
5. Enter your login credentials if you haven't already.
6. After the download completes, click on **Import**.
7. In the **Import Unity Package** dialog window, click **Import**.
8. The importing process adds several different folders to the **Project** tab.
