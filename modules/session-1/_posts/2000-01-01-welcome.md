In this session we are going to start on our online journey talking about Unity.  It's a powerful Game Engine that allows us to create any game we want. However, we are going to stick to the basics and use built-in tools so we can focus on design and avoid some of the complexity.

<!-- The final topic will touch on the power of JS and node.js for server-side development. A number of JavaScript libraries will be explored for how they can speed up the artistic process. -->
