In this session we are going to start on our online journey talking about Unity.  It's a powerful Game Engine that allows us to create any game we want using art assets provide or even ones that we create or find. However, we are going to stick to the basics and use built-in tools so we can focus on design and avoid some of the complexity.

<!-- The final topic will touch on the power of JS and node.js for server-side development. A number of JavaScript libraries will be explored for how they can speed up the artistic process. -->

## What to Expect

This session introduces you to a new technology, while also asking you to think about design and content creation. 


## Session Goals

1. Learn how to problem solve. (More specifically, how to break a problem down into sub-problems that are easier to solve by themselves)
2. Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. (Skills acquisition.)
3. Combine technical and artistic practices through inquiry and iteration.
